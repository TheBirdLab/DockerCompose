# [Gitea](stacks/gitea/README.md)

[Gitea](https://docs.gitea.com/) is a painless self-hosted all-in-one software development service, it includes Git hosting, code review, team collaboration, package registry and CI/CD. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab. Gitea was forked from Gogs originally and almost all the code has been changed. See the Gitea Announcement blog post to read about the justification for a fork.
